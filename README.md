# This Is How Food Should Be

## Introduction

This is a webpage that displays images of the most mouth-watering foods imaginable. When a food image is clicked, the details for the food will be displayed in the section below the images including an enlarged image of the food, the name of the food, a description of the food, the name of the restaurant where the food came from, the location of the restaurant, a clickable link that takes you to the Google Maps location for the restaurant, and a clickable link that takes you to the Yelp page for the restaurant.

All you need to do is click on the image of a food that you like, you'll see all of the information for the food and restaurant where that image was taken, and then off you go to your next food adventure. Excited? Great! After all - this is how food should be! Mouthwatering and exciting! Have fun! :wink:
