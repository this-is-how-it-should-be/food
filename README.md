# This Is How Food Should Be

## Introduction

This is a webpage that displays images of the most mouth-watering foods imaginable. When a food image is clicked, the details for the food will be displayed within the detail display section of the web page including an enlarged image of the food, the name of the food, the name of the restaurant where the food came from, and address with a clickable link that takes you to Google Maps.

All you need to do is click on a food that you like, you'll see all of the information for the restaurant where that image was taken, and then off you go to your next food adventure. Excited? Great! After all - this is how food should be! Mouthwatering and exciting! Have fun! :wink:
